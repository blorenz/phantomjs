    This is a wrapper for the script to be executed.
    When remote debugging, there's no way to reload the page
    to be able to run the script being debugged, because there's
    no user-facing way to interact with phantomjs.
    This provides a function wrapper around the script in order to
    make the whole script callable from the console on the remote debugger.
